# Reading Note: Real-Time Polygonal-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines
## Definition and Properties
$D_{0}$ denotes the original distribution to be transformed. To generate a new distribution $D_{0}$, a linear transformation represented by a 3x3 matrix $M$ is applied to the direction vector $w_{0}$ of the original distribution $D_{0}$, where we get $w=\frac {Mw_{0}}{\left \|  Mw_{0}\right \|}$.

The magnitude of an LTSD is the magnitude of the original distribution $D_{0}$ in the original direction $w_{0}$ multiplied by the change of solid angle measure due to the distortion of the spherical transformation. It has the closed-form expression:
<center>
$$D(w)=D(w_{0})\frac {\partial w_{0}}{\partial w}=D_{0}(\frac {M^{-1}w}{\left \|  M^{-1}w\right \|})\frac {\left |  M^{-1}\right |}{\left \|  M^{-1}w\right \|^{3}}$$
</center>
where $\frac {\partial w_{0}}{\partial w}=\frac {\left |  M^{-1}\right |}{\left \|  M^{-1}w\right \|^{3}}$ is the Jacobian of the transformation of normalized direction vectors  $w=\frac {Mw_{0}}{\left \|  Mw_{0}\right \|}$.
The distribution is invariant to scaling transformations $(M = \lambda I )$ since scaling vectors doesnâ€™t change their directions. Furthermore, rotations only change the orientation of the distribution, not its shape. This is because the Jacobian of the spherical transformation is constant if $M$ is a scaling or rotation matrix: $\frac {\partial w_{0}}{\partial w}=1$.
The transformed distribution $D$ inherits several properties of the original distribution $D_{0}$. Properties of are listed below:
- **Normalization** The norm of an LTSD $D$ is the norm of its original distribution $D_{0}$.
<center>
$$\int _{\Omega }D(w)dw=\int _{\Omega }D(w_{0})\frac {\partial w_{0}}{\partial w}dw=\int _{\Omega }D_{0}(w_{0})dw_{0}$$
</center>
- **Integration over Polygons** The integral of an LTSD $D$ over a polygon $P$ is the integral of the original distribution $D_{0}$ over the polygon $P_{0} = M^{-1}P$ obtained by applying the inverse transformation $M^{-1}$ to each vertex of the polygon:
<center>
$$\int _{P}D(w)dw=\int _{P_{0}}D_{0}(w_{0})dw_{0}$$
</center>
- **Important Sampling** Because $D$ is $D_{0}$ multiplied by the Jacobian of the transformation, the probability density function(PDF) of the sample $w$ is exactly $D(w)$.
<center>
$PDF(w_{0})=D_{0}(w_{0}) \Rightarrow PDF(w)=D_{0}(w_{0})\frac {\partial w_{0}}{\partial w}=D(w)$
</center>
## Approximating Physically Based BRDFs with Linearly Transformed Cosines

Define the original distribution $D_{0}$ which is a normalized clamped cosine distribution in the hemisphere given by the z-direction:
<center>
$$D_{0}(w_{0} = (x, y, z)) = \frac{1}{\pi}max(0, z)$$
</center>
<center>

</center>
Approximate the spherical functions given by the cosine-weighted GGX BRDFs over the light directions $w_{l}$:
<center>
$$D \approx f(w_{v}, w_{l}) cos\theta _{l}$$
</center>
Assume an isotropic material, the BRDF depends on the incident direction $w_{v} = (sin\theta _{v}, 0, cos\theta _{v})$ and the roughness parameter $\alpha$.  A matrix $M$ could yield the best fit with a Linearly Transformed Cosine. Because of the planar symmetry of isotropic BRDFs and Linearly Transformed Cosine's scale invariant,  the Matrix $M$ can be represented as:
<center>
$$M =\begin{bmatrix}
a&0&b\\
0&c&0\\
d&0&1
\end{bmatrix}$$
</center>
So only 4 parameters need to be fitted. More detail about the representation and storage, please see the paper. 
## Real-Time Polygonal-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines
Shading with diffuse polygonal lights means computing the illumination integral over a polygonal domain:
<center>
$$I = \int_{P}L(w_{l})f(w_{v}, w_{l}) cos\theta _{l}dw_{l}$$
</center>
then an approximation can be derived:
<center>
$$I = \int_{P}L(w_{l})f(w_{v}, w_{l}) cos\theta _{l}dw_{l} \approx \int_{P}L(w_{l})D(w_{l})dw_{l}$$
</center>
### Shading with Constant Polygonal Lights
If the radiance emitted by the polygonal light is spatially constant, it means $L(w_{l})=L$. Then it becomes a separable multiplication factor of the integral:
 <center>
$$I \approx \int_{P}L(w_{l})D(w_{l})dw_{l} = L\int_{P}D(w_{l})dw_{l}$$
</center>
because we have the polygonal integration property above, the integration can be simplified to:
<center>
$\int _{P}D(w)dw=\int _{P_{0}}D(w_{0})dw_{0}=E(P_{0})$
</center>
where $E$ is the irradiance of the polygon $P_{0} = M^{-1}P$. Since $D_{0}$ is a clamped cosine distribution, its integral over a polygon is the irradiance of this polygon, which has a closed-form expression:
<center>
$$E(p_{1},...,p_{n})=\frac {1}{2\pi }\sum _{i=1}^{n}acos(\left \langle \boldsymbol{p}_{i}, \boldsymbol{p}_{j}\right \rangle)\left \langle \frac{\boldsymbol{p_{i}}\times \boldsymbol{p_{j}}}{\left \|  \boldsymbol{p_{i}}\times \boldsymbol{p_{j}}\right \|}, \begin{bmatrix}
0\\ 
0\\ 
1
\end{bmatrix}\right \rangle$$
</center>
with $j = (i + 1)\space mod\space n$.
